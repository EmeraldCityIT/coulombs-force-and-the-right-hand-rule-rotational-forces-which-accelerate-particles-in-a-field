By using the "Right Hand" rule, particles which are to be accelerated via an electric field can gain increased velocity from an initial rotational acceleration which follows the right hand model. Newton's first law states that if an electromagnetic field is to accelerate a particle from rest, not only must the particle move from rest to travel along the field, but must also start from rest tp accelerate in a right hand rotational motion. This repository contains research related to creating the initial rotational motion through the use of sound. Sound wave powered rotational motion will allow particles which are no longer at rest to continue to accelerate in a rotational motion when a magnetic field is applied, this acceleration from a not rest state will greatly increase the velocities at which electromagnetic fields are able to achieve in particle research.
